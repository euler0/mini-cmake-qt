# Minimal CMake Template for Qt 5 Projects

*This branch is for Qt 5. Visit [main](https://github.com/euler0/mini-cmake-qt/tree/main) branch if you are looking for the Qt 6 template.*

This is a minimal, but complete and production-ready CMake project template for Qt 5 projects. This may be a starting point for your new application. If that is not intent to be a cross-platform project, you can clean up that stuffs from the template.
